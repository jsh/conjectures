    "Here's a conjecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set of all powers of a prime, from 1 to p^k: P = {p^0, p^1, p^2, ... p^k}.\n",
    "Pull out two subsets, S & T, that don't intersect.\n",
    "Take the means of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conjecture: $\\mu(S) != \\mu(T)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if p is 2 and k is 10 P = {1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 1024} \n",
    "If S = {1, 2, 8} and T = {4, 16, 32}, then $\\mu(S) = 11/3$ and $\\mu(T) = 52/3$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conjecture is that this holdsfor any two finite, non-intersecting set of powers of p, a prime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking with powers of $p = 2$, here's another way to say this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, *every* integer is a unique sum of powers of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "17 = 16 + 1\n",
    " 7 = 4 + 2 + 1\n",
    "11 = 8 + 2 + 1\n",
    "52 = 32 + 16 + 4\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read that sum right from the number's binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "17 = 10001\n",
    "7 = 111\n",
    "11 = 1011\n",
    "52 = 110100\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the average of a series that sums to N is just N/(# of 1-bits in the binary representation of N) . \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I'll make up a term: I'll call the inverse of this -- (# of 1-bits in the binary representation /  N) -- the 1's density. I'm not crazy about this term and would love a better one. but let me use it for a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does sort of correspond to your intuition. If a number is big but it doesn't have very many 1-bits in its binary representation, then the 1's density is low. If a number's little, but its binary representation is full of 1's, then the 1's density is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$512 = 1000000000(base2)$ -- low 1's density\n",
    "$15 = 1111(base 2)$ -- high 1's density.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the averages are the same, the inverses of the averages are the same, too. I'm claiming two different integers won't ever have the same 1's density -- I'm saying 17 (10001) and 8 (1000) won't have the same 1's density.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, wait. That's not right. I'm claiming that as long as they don't have any of the *same* one bits set, they won't have the same 1's density.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a more grandiose question: Will *any* two integers ever have the same 1's density?\n",
    "Why yes, they will.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I look at, say, the first 100 integers, 69 and 92 have the same 1's density. :-(\n",
    "69 has 3 one-bits, 92 has 4 one-bits. (3/69= 1/23 = 4/92).  But they share bits!\n",
    "69 = 1000101(base 2) and 92 = 1011100(base 2), so they both share 64 = 2^6 and 4 = 2^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the conjecture in pseudo-code, for $p = 2$\n",
